                                                    <p>
                                                        It is compulsory for all overseas students to have health insurance to obtain a visa. 
            You have to be insured for the whole period of study in Australia. 
            OHSC is a health insurance that covers basic medical treatment, emergency transport, hospital treatment and visits to a general practitioner (GP). 
            Part of your medical bill payment is returned by the insurance company (you can claim some of your money back). 
            Contact us for more information about OSHC or to start or renew your insurance policy.

            <h4>What is the cost of living in Australia? What is a weekly budget for living expenses? How much money do I need to take with me?</h4>
        </div>
        <p>
            The cost of living in Australia is cheaper than in other English speaking countries such as the UK and USA 
            but it may not be as cheap as living at home with your family. 
            Overseas students also have the opportunity to work on a part time basis and support themselves during their stay in Australia. 
            A weekly budget will depend on your own requirements. We recommend to anticipate around $1,500 for basic expenses per month.

            <h4>What kind of accommodation can I find in Australia?</h4>
        </div>
        <p>
            There is a variety of accommodation available to suit different budgets and needs, including private accommodation 
            or a homestay with an Australian family. Shared accommodation with other students is a popular option, 
            and student noticeboards and newspapers often advertise rooms, apartments and houses for rent. 
            If you decide for shared accommodation then you will be living with some other students who rent and share a unit or a house. 
            Home stay gives the option of staying with an Australian family who takes care of you, but it is also more expensive. 
            Other options are accommodation in hostel, backpackers or hotels. Prices in these vary from cheap to expensive.
